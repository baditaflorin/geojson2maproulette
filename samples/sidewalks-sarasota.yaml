slug: sidewalks-sarasota
title: Add sidewalks to major roads in Sarasota
instruction: This way has no `sidewalk` tag. Usually you can see from the aerial imagery if there is a sidewalk or not. Please add the appropriate `sidewalk` tagging.
help: "Help make OSM be a better resource for safe, walkable streets! Many primary and secondary roads in the US are not safe for pedestrians if there is no sidewalk. This challenge highlights all `primary` and `secondary` ways that have no [`sidewalk`](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:sidewalk) tagging whatsoever. You can help by looking at aerial imagery and adding the appropriate `sidewalk` tagging. `sidewalk=no` is just as important to have as the 'positive' values. Thanks for helping make OSM better!"
