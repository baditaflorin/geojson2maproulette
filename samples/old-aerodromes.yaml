title: Old Aerodromes in Vermont
instruction: This is an `aerodrome` node that has not been looked at in at least three years. Please check if there is an airport or airfield there. If there is nothing, you can delete the node. If the `aerodrome` exists, why not map the runway, apron, hangars etc.? Thanks!
help: "Many `aerodrome` nodes in the U.S. were imported from a number of sources. Not all these nodes represent existing airfields or airports. This challenge shows all `aerodrome` nodes that have not been touched since January 2013. The objective is to get rid of all `aerodrome` nodes that do not point to an existing airfield or airport, and update the ones that do exist with more detailed data and the correct location."
